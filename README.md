Qualitative Assessment:
We divided the code into 7 separate files: Main, Worker, SuperWorker, Robot, IWorkable, IFeedable, and Manager.  We decided to split the code into these separate files because once we begin to add more methods and functionality to the classes, it will be easier to extend the code without affecting the other classes.  The separate files will also make the groupwork will more manageable.  If each team member has a file to work on then we get more work accomplished.
