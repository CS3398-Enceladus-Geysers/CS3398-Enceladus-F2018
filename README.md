Qualitative Assessment:
We divided the code into 7 separate files: Main, Worker, SuperWorker, Robot,
IWorkable, IFeedable, and Manager.  We decided to split the code into these
separate files because once we begin to add more methods and functionality to
the classes, it will be easier to extend the code without affecting the other
classes ().  The separate files will also make the groupwork more manageable.
If each team member has a file to work on then we get more work accomplished.
Also, by creating Ifeedable and Iworkable we can make sure that some clients
(robots) do not have to use an interface that they do not need such as
IFeedable.
